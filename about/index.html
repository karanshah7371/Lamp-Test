      <h3>About LAMP</h3>
      <h1>Here's why we build LAMP</h1>
      <h4>
        Our mission is to make brands feel more confident and fun on social
        media.
      </h4>

      <h4>Here's our story of starting LAMP</h4>
      <div>
        <img src="./images/startup.svg" alt="" />
        <div>
          <p>
            It all began a while back when we were enthusiastically building our
            startup. It was a completely different feel.
            <br /><br />
            Being a small team we have to look after many different things.
            <br /><br />
            We have to constantly create a much better product, manage sales and
            gotta go through a lot of barriers that hindered our foucs from our
            goal.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div>
        <img src="./images/Group 35587.svg" alt="" />
        <div>
          <p>
            One such barrier was managing social media for our brand.
            <br /><br />
            It s like endless content creation and strategizing about what to
            share when, logging in and out of multiple social accounts to see if
            we are meeting daily or weekly goals.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div>
        <img src="./images/Group 35588.svg" alt="" />
        <div>
          <p>
            And that's not even counting all the time it takes deciding what
            content to create or post in the first place.
            <br /><br />
            We spend days on our social content but no-one likes it or shares
            it! Agencies were very expensive and freelancers didn't provide what
            we exactly wanted.
          </p>

      <h4>Like us, there were many brands facing the same problem.</h4>
      <h3>
        We wanted to solve the problem for all and that's why we created LAMP.

      <div>

        <div>

            creating and posting content for you and organically engaging with
            your community. <br /><br />
            That's too by offering simple and cost efficient subscription based
            plans.
